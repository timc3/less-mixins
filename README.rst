Introduction:
-------------

This is a collection of mixins that I use when developing applications
and sites mainly to help with vendor specific prefixes.

Usage:
------

In your less file import the less mixin file at the top of the page, and at the same path as your less file:: 

   @import "less_mixin";

When the less file compiles (using something like lessc or lessapp it will compile the mixins into your main css file).
